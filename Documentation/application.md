# Application Startup Documentation
## To build and start the application, follow these steps using yarn:

### Building the Application

- To prepare the application for production, you need to compile the source code.

- Open your terminal or command prompt in the project's root directory.

Run the build command:
```bash
yarn build
```

This command will typically create an optimized, static build of your application (often in a directory named dist or build).

### Starting the Application

- Once the application is built, you can serve the production-ready files.

- Ensure the build step (yarn build) was completed successfully.

Run the start command:
```bash
yarn start
```

The terminal output will generally indicate the address (http://localhost:3000) where the application is accessible.
